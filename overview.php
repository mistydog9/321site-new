Web designers are like a box of chocolates: <I>You never know what you're gonna get.</I>
<P>Some are hard-core coders, great when you need a complex script but less adept at implementing stylistic visual effects.</P> 
<P>Graphic gurus often work up wondrous concepts without regard to practical concerns such as download times or how it will look in another browser. </P> 
<P>Others are converted marketing types: skilled verbally, but lacking either of the above technical attributes. </P>
<%=gutter?>
Then come the punchy sales types: quick with a joke, but equally adept at exaggerating expectations and clouding the truth.</P> 
<P>At <B>321site</B>, you get the best of all worlds: technical, artistic, verbal and... honest! We have plenty of experience in programming, print graphics, copy writing, and marketing, with minimal experience in twisting your arm to buy something unnecessary. </P> 
<P>We have the perspective and time to work with you on a personal basis toward effective, affordable, appropriate solutions.</P>
