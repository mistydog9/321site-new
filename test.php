<p><b>&#147;</b>Jim is the best developer/designer/multimedia person I ever worked with (and I've worked with quite a few!). He would get jobs done correctly and on time - an issue I struggled with when working with many of the developers, designers, etc. at Fusive.com. Being from a financial publishing background, where work came in QUICKLY and had to be done right and corrected perfectly, Jim was the shining star I went to again and again. When I left to start my own business, I also hired Jim to design our company Website and I would hire him again. Please feel free to contact me for more information. allaboutmd@earthlink.net 863-441-2986<b>&#148;</b></p>

<p><b>&#147;</b>Jim was especially sensitive to creating a web page for my small business on a limited budget. He was creative and effective and the web page went on line quickly. It already has garnered compliments and importantly, has
also lead to business contacts.</p>

<p>"I had the pleasure of working with Jim directly. What impressed me at first, was Jim's ability to communicate effectively with the customer. Many people can communicate, but only few truly effectively communicate. Jim was able to get to heart of the matter quickly, provide the customer what they wanted, and because of his communication, he could provide the desired result on the first shot. This saved us tremendous overhead and made a great impression with the client-- consistently resulting in return business. Jim's communication, ability to surpass expectations, and attention to detail makes him an amazing asset."</p>
